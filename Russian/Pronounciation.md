# Pronounciation / Stress

Russian has a pretty complex pronounciation symbol where it has a mixture of hard and soft variations of consonants, two forms of vowels and on top of that: stress.

# Stress (удар*е*ние)
^a499a1

In Russian writing there is no symbol to indicate stress, but in learning material there is usually an indicator for stress. For example, the bolded "o" in oкн**o**.

Figuring out where to place the stress in a Russian word is usually impossible, this is why you learn the stress along with the word itself. However, there are several patterns to help figure out where the stress *might* be placed within a word.

- stress never falls on the endings -ий/-ый

Take these rules with a grain of salt since Russians say "нет правил без исключений" or, there are no rules without exceptions.

# How does stress affect vowels?

Stress in russian affects vowels a lot, but only certain vowels. The vowels which are affected are: o, a, e and я.

### The vowel o

In the syllable before the stress, the letter 'o' sounds like /a/

For example:

- oкн**o** -> akno -> window
- Москв**a** -> maskva -> Moscow

### The vowels o and a

Anywhere after the stress, and more than one syllable before the stress, the letters 'o' and 'a' sound like /ə/ (the 'a' in orca)

- к**o**смос -> космəс -> cosmos
- л**a**мпа -> лампə -> lamp
- каранд**a**ш -> кəрандаш -> pencil
- проф**e**ссор -> прафессəр -> professor
- хорош**o** -> хəрашо -> good

### The vowels e and я

In the syllable *before* the stress, the letters e and я are pronounced like и

- сестр**a** -> с'истра -> sister
- мечт**a** -> м'ичта -> dream
- пятиэт**a**жка -> п'итиэтажка -> five-story building

Anywhere *after* the stress and more than one syllable *before* the stress, e and я are pronounced like /je/

- н**o**мер -> ном'əр -> number
- уч**и**тель -> учит'əл' -> teacher
- д**e**сять -> д'ес'əт' -> ten
- д**я**дя -> д'ад'ə -> uncle

## Soft and Hard Signs

Russian has two signs called a soft sign (ьЬ) and a hard sign (ъЪ)

The hard sign (ъЪ) is found *within* words and is used to seprarate the prefix from the root of the word when the prefix ends in a consonant and the root of the word begins with one of the following vowels: я, ю, e or ё

Words like: (the prefix of the word is bolded)

|Word|Translation|Word|Translation|
|-|-|-|-|
|объ**е**зд|detour|подъём|lifting, raising, ascent|
|объ**е**кт|object|сбъзд|gathering|
|субъ**е**кт|individual|объём|volume, capacity, amount|
|подъ**е**зд|approach, entrance|бъезд|entry, entrance|

The soft sign is usually found *within* or at the end of a word (usually a verb)

### How can I tell the sign?

You can tell if a consonant is prounced hard if:

- there is no soft sign (ьЬ) following it
- there is a hard sign (ъЪ) following it
- it is followed by one of these vowel symbols: a, э, o, y or ы
- the letters ж, ш, ц will always be pronounced hard, even if they are followed by a soft sign

You can tell if a consonant is pronounced soft if:

- there is a soft sign (ьЬ) which usally comes at the end of a word
- one of the following vowel symbols: я, е, ё, ю or и
- the letters ч or щ will always be pronounced soft

How it works is that those vowels indicate that the precending consonant is prounounced in it's soft form and followed by the vowel *sound*: a, э, o, y or ы
