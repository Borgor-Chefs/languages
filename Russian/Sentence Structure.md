# Sentence Structure

Russian is traditionally a SVO (subject-verb-object) language, unlike English, nouns have explicit cases. Words can be rearranged to create new meanings, in English this is done via. word order and indicator words.

For example, in Russian, you can play with the ordering of SVO to produce new meanings

|SOV|The emphasis in on the type of dessert that the object likes|Я мороженное люблю|
|OSV|A pensive statement that emphasies that the speaker does like ice cream. Informal tone|Мороженное я люблю
|OVS|The emphasis is on the fact that it is the speaker who likes ice cream|Мороженное люблю я|
|VOS|A declarative statement with a poetic undertone|Люблю мороженное я|
|VSO|A reflective, declaratice statement for placing the accent on the speaker's love for ice cream|Люблю я мороженное|

For reference, the words used are:
