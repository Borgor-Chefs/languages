	- intransitive verb -> describes a verb that does not give nor take \[sb/sth]
		- The man stumbled twice -> nothing was given nor taken, only an action was performed
- adjective -> a descriptor for a noun
- adverb -> a descriptor for a verb
- direct object -> the recipient of the action of a verb
	- she sees *the dog* -> the dog, being the direct object
- indirect object -> indicates that \[sb/sth] recieves \[sth]
	- I gave *the man* salt -> the man, being the indirect object

## Noun Cases

Where verbs have tenses, nouns have cases which indicate their function within a sentence.

In some languages, a noun's case is designated either by an indicator word (\'s, on, with, by) or by a special prefix/suffix added to the word. Of course, the form of the case varies by language.

### What kinds of cases are there?

There is the...

- nominative (subjective) case -> marks the subject of a verb, the noun "that is doing something"
- accusative (objective) case -> marks the direct object of a transitive verb
- dative case -> marks the recipient of an action
- genitive (possessive) case -> marks a word (usually a noun) which modifies another word
- ablative case -> usually marks motion away from something
- partitive case -> this shows that the object is part of a whole (de in French)
- instrumental case -> this shows that some object is done with this object (e.g., with a pen)
