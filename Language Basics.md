# Language Basics

## Terminology

- noun -> a person, place or thing
- verb -> an action
	- transitive verb -> describes a verb that gives or takes \[sb/sth]
		- I fed the dog -> the dog was given food
	- intransitive verb -> describes a verb that does not give nor take \[sb/sth]
		- The man stumbled twice -> nothing was given nor taken, only an action was performed
- adjective -> a descriptor for a noun
- adverb -> a descriptor for a verb
- direct object -> the recipient of the action of a verb
	- she sees *the dog* -> the dog, being the direct object
- indirect object -> indicates that \[sb/sth] recieves \[sth]
	- I gave *the man* salt -> the man, being the indirect object

## Noun Cases

Where verbs have tenses, nouns have cases which indicate their function within a sentence.

In some languages, a noun's case is designated either by an indicator word (\'s, on, with, by) or by a special prefix/suffix added to the word. Of course, the form of the case varies by language.

### What kinds of cases are there?

There is the...

- nominative (subjective) case -> marks the subject of a verb, the noun "that is doing something"
- accusative (objective) case -> marks the direct object of a transitive verb
- dative case -> marks the recipient of an action
- genitive (possessive) case -> marks a word (usually a noun) which modifies another word
- ablative case -> usually marks motion away from something
- partitive case -> marks an object that is part of a whole (e.g., the "de" indication in French)
- instrumental case -> this shows that some action is done with this object (e.g., with a pen, Polish is a great example)

To better understand how noun cases work, we can examine a sentence from Latin. The function of each noun in Latin is shown by it's suffix.

>Filia agricolae rosam dat poetae

We can break this sentence up into each word and what case each noun is in (each case ending is bolded)

|Word|Translation|Function|Reasoning|
|---|---|---|---|
|fili**a**|the daughter|nominative noun|The daughter is doing \[sth]|
|agricola**e**|farmer's|genitive noun|agricola**e** is in the genitive and modifies "daughter"|
|ros**am**|a rose|accusative noun|this is the object which is being given, a.k.a. the direct object|
|dat|to give|transitive verb|this is the action being performed
|poeta**e**|to the poet|dative noun|this is the recipient of the action|

Using each individually translated word, we can form the sentence's direct translation (we have to add articles because Latin doesn't have any):

>The daughter farmer's rose gives to the poet

We can observe that the sentence structure is SOV. Because English relies heavily on word order, this sentence makes little grammatical sense. We can rearrange each word in accordance to proper English, which yields the sentence:

>The farmer's daughter gives a rose to the poet

We can still make some sense of the direct translation because English, like every other language has noun cases, but many speakers never think in these terms. 

What happens is that speakers look for indicator words. These can be explicit words like articles, subject markers (like in Korean), suffixes (Latin, English), prefixes (Russian), etc. For English we'd look for

- 's -> denotes the possession of \[sth]
- to the -> denotes a recipient
- the daughter -> is the first word and has "the" which denotes a subject
- a rose -> denotes an object because of the "a" article
