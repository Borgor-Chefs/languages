# Languages

This is a repo for notes about languages. This covers more than just the basics of an individual language, but more about linguistics and grammar.

There are examples within each category.

>Remember that a language is all about memorization, you must repeat repeat and repeat.

## What are good ways to learn?

- Using flash cards for memory are a great way to learn
- Watching videos in the target language to get an ear for that type of accent
- Playing RPGs is a great way to learn a language since a lot of information is communicated via. text. You could also pick up grammar this way.

## Tips

- Don't be afraid to make mistakes, just be sure to leanr from them
- Don't focus on grammar early on, learn phrases and how they are properly pronounced
	- But, eventually you will have to learn it. You will have to think about what you're saying and not just parroting generic phrases that you've been taught
- Ideally, you'd get someone who speaks the language natively to teach you
- Don't limit yourself to just *one* resource, use a shit tone
- There are people who have achieved native-status with a language by reading alone
	- You can pick up a lot of slang and grammar this way
- Use color markers for gender, if a noun in a language has gender (masc, fem, neuter) use blue, pink or yellow respectively to mark that word's gender.
	- This is important for languages such as Russian, German, Latin, French, etc.
